# random-adventure-plot-generator
Generate a list of TV tropes, monsters, locations (and maybe more), drawn from random tables, to be used for inspiration in writing a D&amp;D (or other fantasy RPG) adventure.

## TODO
- save tags from TVTropes pages, so that they can be filtered (e.g., "Locations")
- save source handbook for DnD monsters, there are too many named monsters
